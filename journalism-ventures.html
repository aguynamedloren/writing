<h2>An unfinished list of ventures in journalism you should be watching (and why)</h2>

<p>One thing that makes current times so interesting for journalism is that everybody is still looking for a model that will work for journalism in the 21st century. Given the speed of technological change and the complexity of what is now the media landscape, it's unlikely we'll ever find a model that will work for more than a few years for more than a few publishers. The hype around native advertising or metered paywalls is primarily a manifestation of the hope for silver bullets.</p>

<p>There will have to be lots of experiments.</p>

<p>So here's a list of journalism ventures worth watching closely, each for a different set of reasons.</p>

<p>I'm fully aware that this list falls short of highlighting all the movers and shakers in the field of journalism. That's why I put <a href="https://github.com/davidbauer/writing">this article on Github</a> for everyone to edit and suggest additions (if you prefer the comments section or <a href="http://www.twitter.com/davidbauer">Twitter</a>, that's of course fine, too). My view is inevitably biased towards European and English language ventures, so I'm especially glad if you point me to ventures from Africa, South America and Asia.</p>

<p>For now, I've left out all the ventures that are entering the media sphere from a tech background, like Twitter, LinkedIn, Flipboard, Zite and many more. Neither have I included the likes of The New York Times or The Guardian, assuming that everyone is watching them already.</p>
